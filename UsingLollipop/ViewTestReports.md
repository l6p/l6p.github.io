# View Test Reports

## The Overview Report

The overview report reflects the main data that needs to be examined during the test execution, and is updated automatically during the test run.

Requests per minute (RPM) reflects the overall performance of the system, the higher the RPM value under heavy load, and the more stable it is, the better the performance of the system.

## The Insight Report

The insight report reflects more specific test data. 
You can view specific data such as the number of requests, time spent, percentage of failures, etc. for all the URLs accessed during the test. 

The system provides a coefficient of variation (CV) to measure how trustworthy the statistics are, 
a large coefficient of variation means that the system under test is not stable enough, and the data obtained from the test is not trustworthy.
